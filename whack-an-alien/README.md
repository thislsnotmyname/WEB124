# JavaScript30 Project 3: Whack-an-Alien
This project's goal was to "improve" on a project from [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/). The base of this project is Day 30: Whack-a-Mole. I took the base idea of the game Whack-a-Mole and added a high score variable which saves with localStorage, a visual timer, and several variants of "aliens" that give differing amount of points.

A (semi) new concept introduced to me was [setTimeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/setTimeout) and, by extension, [setInterval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/setInterval). I had tried to use it in the past, but I understand it better now that I was shown an example of how to use it. One challenging part of this project was understanding the styles and how to change them properly.
