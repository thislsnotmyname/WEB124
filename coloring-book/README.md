# JavaScript30 Project 1: Coloring Book
This project's goal was to "improve" on a project from [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/). The base of this project is Day 8: Fun with HTML5 Canvas. I took the base idea of using the HTML5 canvas element and created a virtual coloring book.

A new concept introduced to me through this project was HTML5's Canvas API, which doubles as a challenging element in this project.
