# JavaScript30 Project 2: Task List
This project's goal was to "improve" on a project from [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/). The base of this project is Day 15: LocalStorage and Event Delegation. I took the base idea of using the localStorage object of the browser and made a task board with it.

A new concept introduced to me through this project was JavaScript's [window.localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) object. A challenging part of the project was figuring out how to filter and sort tasks by their properties. Using localStorage was not particularly challenging, though learning its ins and outs was very interesting.
